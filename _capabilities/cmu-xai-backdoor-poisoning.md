## Overview
We propose an approach to analyze and identify backdoor poisoned classifiers with adversarial examples. Based on this approach, we develop a classifier forensics tool, where our tool helps users visualize adversarial examples and test the predictions under different custom patches. For more details on our approach and tool, see our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09080) and [demo](https://github.com/Eric-mingjie/xai-classifier-forensics-tool).


## Intended Use
Our tool aims to help users easily analyze poisoned classifiers with a user-friendly interface. When users want to analyze a poisoned classifier or identify if a classifier is poisoned, they can use our classifier forensics tool. 


## Limitations
Our approach considers mostly patch based backdoor poisoning.
